                        <h3>1st Project Update: Learning the basics/ fundamentals of coding a Blockchain</h3>
						<p>A blockchain by design should be in a sense an immutable decentralized network which is able to keep track of things like transactions for example on a ledger. For this 1st project update I will try to explain what I have learnt in terms of the fundamentals of building a blockchain on Python. A blockchain is secured using a hash system which stores the information for the given block securely. This is secure because if anything within the blockchain is changed the hash will change drastically thus the network can automatically determine where the inconsistent transaction occurred and as a result deny it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I will be using Python for this project as I am more comfortable with the language as it is much more simplistic compared to other languages. First of all we have to import the hashlib library as it will be used to generate the hash for each block later on. Moving on we have to define our block as a class. The first part is the initializer which requires the input of the previous hash and the transactions that will be stored in this current block. Next up we have to construct a data string which is called block data in order to store the transactions as a string. On top of that we also create a block hash to store the hash code generated by sha-256 for the unique data stored in the given block.
                        </p>

                        <p>As this is just a fundamental look at the basics of building a blockchain I will populate the transactions here myself. By right, the transactions should be populated in the network and cross-checked by a network of miners. 
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/byte/2.png"></a>
                        <p>Now with the populated transactions we can begin to look into generating our first block. Lets just say Bytecoin can only hold two transactions per block thus we can fill in the necessary details into our class initializer. 
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/byte/3.png"></a>
                        <p>The results can be seen here:
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/byte/4.png"></a>
                        <p>Now with that done, letâ€™s take a look at what happens if I change the transaction amount by even a small amount. 
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/byte/5.png"></a>
                        <p>As we can observe the hash system is working and makes sure everything should be secure. Now let us build two more blocks with the remaining transactions we have. 
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/byte/6.png"></a>
                        <p>The results of the blockchain would look something like this:
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/byte/7.png"></a>
                        <p>Now to test whether our hash system actually works lets change a small detail in the transaction list and see what happens to the hash of the 3 blocks we generated. The results were as shown:
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/byte/8.png"></a>
                        <p>As we can see all the hashes in the blockchain have changed just because I made a small alteration in the first transaction. This can now confirm that our blockchain works in terms of its bare necessities. The blockchain can track transactions made in the network using the hash system which cannot be altered, as it will cause the whole blockchain hash to diverge.
                        </p>
